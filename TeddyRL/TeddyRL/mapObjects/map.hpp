/* TODO: Maybe we should simplify this?
 
    Instead of having a 2D vector, we should have a 1D vector.
    Then, if we want to move on the (x,y) location, we simply iterate through all entities, and check their position. If on our desired position there isn't anything, we can move. If there is a wall, we stop.
    But what if there are many, many entities and we want to implement AOE?
    Current entityMapVector has the advantage of an instant access at location we want to move.
 */


#warning good idea - implement this.
/*
    TODO: Or another idea: Instead of an actual entity, let us have a 2D vector of ints.
    Each integer is an index, that corresponds with the place of entity in that array.
    Then we simply check, if the location of our desired place to move our entity is greater than -1 (0 being the first index i.e. a possible entity (or even better - a player)).
    If it is, we can then access simply the 1D vector of entities.
 
    Then, when creating an entity, we will take care of assigning him an index in the EntityMapVector2D. Instead of having a 2D array of type Entity, it is an array of ints!
